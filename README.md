## Description

A team profile creator.

This project was primarily focused on using node.js and OOP. It was a great learning opportunity, and I really enjoyed coding this app while learning about these different aspects of both JS and proeject creation in general.

This app takes user input to build out a team page. The app initially asks for the Team Manager's information, then the user has the ability to add an Engineer or Intern. After all of the team info has been provided, the app will generate an HTML page which shows the team profile and the team members.
